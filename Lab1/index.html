        <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
        <p>
            Rabbits are crepuscular, which means they are active in the mornings and evenings, but spend most of the day asleep or relaxing. So if your bunny lives in a cage, it's a good idea to plan exercise and play time around the times your rabbit is most alert.
